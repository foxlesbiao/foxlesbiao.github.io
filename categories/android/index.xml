Project Elixir Project Elixir is another aftermarket AOSP ROM which basically offers minimal UI enhancement &amp;amp; close to Stock Android ROM with great performance, security and stability. Most of the OEMs' these days will provide slow and untimely updates, but we don&amp;rsquo;t do that here. We closely follow Google to bring the latest updates to our users, and even prolong support for devices that have been declared obsolete by OEMs.</description></item></channel></rss>
